      <h3>📜 History</h3>
      <p>
        Hu Tieu is a prominent dish of Southern Vietnam, especially popular in Saigon and the Mekong Delta. Its origins
        trace back to culinary exchanges between Vietnam and Chinese immigrants, who brought noodles and various rice
        flour sheets. Vietnamese people creatively adapted the dish, creating Hu Tieu with a sweet, clear broth, chewy
        noodles, and diverse toppings including shrimp, pork, chicken, seafood, and fresh herbs.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Initially, Hu Tieu was considered a simple, convenient dish for laborers and city dwellers. As Saigon and the
        Southern region developed, Hu Tieu quickly became popular street food, served in family-run eateries and
        restaurants, reflecting the creativity, convenience, and harmonious flavors of Southern Vietnamese cuisine.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Today, Hu Tieu has many variations, such as Hu Tieu Nam Vang, Hu Tieu My Tho, and Hu Tieu Sa Dec, each
        preserving the sweetness from simmered bones, aromatic spices, and freshness of ingredients. The dish is not
        only a daily meal but also a symbol of Southern Vietnamese culinary heritage, appreciated by chefs and
        international visitors alike, including Gordon Ramsay, who praised Hu Tieu during his culinary journey in the
        Mekong Delta.
